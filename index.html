      <h2>
          FLOATING
      </h2>
      <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: Wendy Luhong</span>
      <p>Floating is a series of work questioning the “value” of wealth and power attached to the rare material like gold, silver, and diamond. Are they beautiful because of the surface or the money attached to them? Gold, silver and diamond clearly can be transferred as currency. The relationship between currency and gold, silver has been there throughout history of human civilizations. Diamond, solid form of element carbon, has been made popular and as a symbol of statues by huge amount of money in diamond marketing in 20th century.</p>
      <p>My conflicting thoughts about them, love and scared at the same time, can be traced back to their relation with money and my intuition about it.
          The intuition about capital is not only not concrete but not subject to the laws of time and space of this world, not possible to ground in ordinary logic makes me panic. Those eternal material just floating in the fantasy of money without a logical theory to explain why they have such high statues that higher than almost everything. 
          </p>
      <p>By exploring the characteristic of shininess and surface reflection of gold , diamond and any other surface has high index of reflection in my video work, I create fictional 3D scene to further express the desire and fear of those materials /which people attached incredibly high value on.  It did not merely reflect the fear and insecurity, but is a portrait of the bubble of wealth and power.
        </p>
      <p>My jewelry Constraint which are made of gold, silver, diamond, red agate and pearls point back to the question and present the physical existence of those material to audiences. </p>
